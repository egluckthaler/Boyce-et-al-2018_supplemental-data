Massospora phylogenomics
====
These data represent the Phylogenomics pipeline used to infer tree for Massospora species from the metagenome data.

A subset of Massospora contigs were annotated with Funannotate (http://funannotate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) based on matches to the core set of 434 conserved Phylogenomic markers used (https://github.com/1KFG/Phylogenomics_HMMs; JGI_1086).

The PHYling pipeline (https://github.com/stajichlab/PHYling_unified) was used to build out homologs, align, concat and build phylogeny. A checked out version of the code is provided in this repository for archival purposes.
